A simple, lightweight (<1MB) & responsive website for a 
professional built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This project utilizes [`webpack-contrib/html-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader) and Tailwind's [@apply directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components/#extracting-css-components-with-apply) to organize the source code in components.
